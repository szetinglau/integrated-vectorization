    "# Azure AI Search integrated vectorization sample\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook demonstrates the [integrated vectorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization) features of Azure AI Search that are currently in public preview. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated vectorization takes a dependency on indexers and skillsets, using the Text Split skill for data chunking, and the AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill and your Azure OpenAI resorce for embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses PDFs from the `data/` folder for chunking, embedding, indexing, and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An Azure subscription, with [access to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access).\n",
    " \n",
    "+ Azure AI Search, any tier, but we recommend Basic or higher for this workload. [Enable semantic ranker](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-how-to-enable-disable) if you want to run a hybrid query with semantic ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A deployment of the `text-embedding-ada-002` model on Azure OpenAI.\n",
